It has very good faculty members and a good place and environment to study and enjoy.

It is a great college to explore your interest in your chosen branch.
Placements: CSE had 100% placements in 2021, and it has been the same for a long time. Other branches also have great placements according to one's abilities. I'm a biotech student, and my seniors of final year also had good placements. Placements isn't a subject of concern in SIT.

Infrastructure: The hostel facilities are great. There are no complaints. The boys' hostel is inside the campus, and the girls' hostel is 3-4 km away from the campus, for 1st and 2nd-year girls. Bus facilities are available to commute to the coll...

There are good placements, but there is no college life.
Placements: There is a good placement record for ISE and CSE branches. Companies like Cisco, Zscaler, Atlassian, Nuclei and others visit our campus. They mainly visit here to hire students for internships and FTE roles. Most of the students of ISE and CSE branches get placed. Some companies offer a salary package of up to 23 LPA.

If you really want to get good placements and study subjects seriously, then it is the best one.
Placements: 85% of students got placed in my course. The highest package offered was 26.6 LPA off-campus and 21 LPA on-campus. The lowest package is 3.5 LPA. The top companies are Nuclei, Cisco, and Z Scaler. Students of 3rd year are offered internships by JPMC and other big companies. All the FTE students get internships. The top roles offered are SDE and mobile developer.

Infrastructure: The facilities are quite good. All the labs are air-conditioned, but the classrooms have simple ceiling fans. You will not feel hot in the summers. There is no extreme temperature in Bangalore, and here we have normal weather over the year. The quality of food is really not good. They try to make northern food but fails. South people also don't like food. Wi-Fi is present on campus after 5 pm and in boys' as well as girls' hostels. But if you get a chance to connect, then the speed is nice. Some...

This private college is good but not best for CS and IT branches.
Placements: About 90% of the students were placed from tech branches with the highest salary package of 29 LPA. From core branches, about 60% of the students were placed with the average salary package of around 5 LPA-6 LPA. Many tech companies allow students of core branches to attend interviews. Mahindra and Tata also visit our campus for placements.

Infrastructure: The library is open to students of all the years of the course until 10 pm at night. The infrastructure is best in SIT Tumkur. Classrooms are neat and clean.
